        The real breakthrough in mechanical computation came in the 19th century with Charles Babbage. 
         Often called the "father of the computer," Babbage designed the Difference Engine,
          a mechanical device intended to automate polynomial calculations. 
          Although it was never completed during his lifetime.
           His later design, the Analytical Engine,
         introduced the idea of a programmable machine, complete with a central processing unit (CPU) and memory.
